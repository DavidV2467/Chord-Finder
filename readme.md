# Chord Finder üéπ‚ùì

Javascript web application that tells you what chord you are playing. Click on the notes to build your chord! 

I started by rewriting my own C++ [console application](https://github.com/ManuelVargas1251/ChordFinder) to javascript and added the interface as I went. Still a work in progress.

### Console Usage
If you don't like the interface you can easily call the functions from the [Chrome Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/)  or use them in your own project.

To find a chord name, use the `updateChord()` function and pass in an array with the notes you want. 

```javascript
updateChord(["A", "C#", "E", "G#"])	//  A Major 7
```

## Interval Library
Below is how I store the relations of the note intervals as well as grouping of intervals commonly called chords.

### Interval Reference

| Minor Second   	|	2	|
| Major Second 	 	|	3 	|
| Minor Third    	|	4	|
| Major Third	    |	5 	|
| Perfect Fourth	|	6 	|
| Augmented Fourth	|	7 	|
| Diminished Fifth	|	7 	|
| Perfect Fifth    	|	8 	|
| Minor Sixth  	   	|	9 	|
| Major Sixth     	|	10 	|
| Minor Seventh   	|	11 	|
| Major Seventh   	|	12 	|
| Perfect Octave  	|	13 	|
