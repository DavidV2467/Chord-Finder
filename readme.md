# Chord Finder

Javascript web app redo from my C++ [console app](https://github.com/ManuelVargas1251/ChordFinder).

[View Demo (Browser Console Only)](https://mnl.space/Chord-Finder/)

## Usage

Currently this is a console application while I work on the user interface. 

To use, click on the demo link above, open the [Chrome Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/) (or equivalent browser console) and you should see an inital chord already executed; if it's not, the program is broken and you should come back later ðŸ˜ž.

To find a chord name, use the `updateChord()` function and pass in an array with the notes you want. 

```javascript
updateChord(["A","C","E"])	//	Result => A Minor
```
